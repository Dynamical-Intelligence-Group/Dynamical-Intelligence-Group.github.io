DIG is looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students who are excited about studying dynamics and learning in artificial and biological neural networks. We are especially interested in those who will positively contribute to the group culture and community more broadly at JHU. 

Interested applicants should email Prof. Will Redman (wredman4@jh.edu) and introduce themselves and their interests.
