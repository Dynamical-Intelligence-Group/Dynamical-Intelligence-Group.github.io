**Aarav Sinha** is a research intern working with Prof. Will Redman at Johns Hopkins University, where he studies how learned neural network dynamics support navigation-related computation. In DIG, his current work includes analyzing recurrent neural networks trained on path-integration tasks to understand when predictive and grid-cell-like representations emerge and how essential they are for performance. He is also involved in embodied emulation projects across academia and industry that connect neural activity to behavior in closed-loop simulated environments. Outside of research, he plays violin in his school orchestra, pursues his interest in entomology, and enjoys drinking matcha with friends.
